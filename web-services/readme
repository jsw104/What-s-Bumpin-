***Running the scripts***
To run the PHP scripts, use this URL:
52.14.0.153/api/"Script Name"
Example:
52.14.0.153/api/get_all_bumps.php

Some scripts require post data to be passed

Post data needed for retrieving messages: "location_id"
Post data need for retrieving bumps by day of week: "location_id"

***What is returned***
Each script returns a JSON array with the first key being "error"
If the value of "error" is "true", then the next key will be "message" which will give a description of what happened
Note: if a query returns empty, "error" is "true"

If "error" is "false" and the query was to add a tuple, than the "message" will simply say that the tuple was successfully added

If "error" is "false" and the query was to return tuples, than the rest of the keys will be the id of that tuple.
The values of those keys will be array with information in them

Keys for retrieving bumps: "location_id" "user_id" "time_stamp"
Example:
{"error":false,"1":{"location_id":"20","user_id":5,"time_stamp":"2017-03-27 01:06:56"},
"2":{"location_id":"20","user_id":5,"time_stamp":"2017-03-26 21:09:39"},
"7":{"location_id":"mitchells","user_id":3,"time_stamp":"2017-03-25 21:25:20"},
"8":{"location_id":"mitchells","user_id":3,"time_stamp":"2017-03-25 21:25:59"},
"9":{"location_id":"tink","user_id":1,"time_stamp":"2017-03-29 13:56:20"}}

Keys for retrieving messages: "location_id" "user_id" "message_field" "time_stamp" (Subject to change)
Example:
{"error":false,"1":{"location_id":"23","user_id":1,"message_field":"hello","time_stamp":"2017-03-26 18:09:07"},
"2":{"location_id":"23","user_id":2,"message_field":"bye","time_stamp":"2017-03-26 18:09:21"}}

1 - 7 correspond to day of the week with 1 being Sundays, 2 being Monday, etc.
Example:
{"error":false,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":1,"6":0,"7":0}
